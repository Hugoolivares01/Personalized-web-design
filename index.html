        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>I'm Michael, and I'm a college student studying computer science. I've always been fascinated by technology and enjoy
        tinkering with computers and gadgets in my free time. Despite the challenging coursework, I've managed to maintain a
        high GPA and am actively involved in several student organizations on campus. In fact, I'm the president of the computer
        science club and enjoy mentoring younger students who share my passion for technology.</p>
        <p>Aside from my studies, I'm an avid runner and have completed several half-marathons. I hope to run a full marathon
            someday. When I'm not running or studying, I volunteer at a local animal shelter. Animal welfare is important to me,
            and I enjoy walking and playing with the dogs at the shelter. In fact, I even adopted a rescue dog of my own. I hope
            to use my computer science skills to develop innovative solutions that will improve the lives of animals and humans
            alike.</p>

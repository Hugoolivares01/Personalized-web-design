        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <div>
            <p>I'm Michael, and I'm a college student studying computer science. I've always been fascinated by
                technology and
                enjoy
                tinkering with computers and gadgets in my free time. Despite the challenging coursework, I've managed
                to
                maintain a
                high GPA and am actively involved in several student organizations on campus. In fact, I'm the president
                of the
                computer
                science club and enjoy mentoring younger students who share my passion for technology.</p>
            <p>Aside from my studies, I'm an avid runner and have completed several half-marathons. I hope to run a full
                marathon
                someday. When I'm not running or studying, I volunteer at a local animal shelter. Animal welfare is
                important to
                me,
                and I enjoy walking and playing with the dogs at the shelter. In fact, I even adopted a rescue dog of my
                own. I
                hope
                to use my computer science skills to develop innovative solutions that will improve the lives of animals
                and
                humans
                alike.</p>
        </div>
        <!-- the divs and h1 were made into collums 1 of them
        need the majoity of the left and the other 
    needing most of the right but also making 1 a div and the 
other an element i allows for me to target general h1 or div
to change each container -->
